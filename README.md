# Car-Price-Prediction-with-ML


This project aims to predict car prices based on various features such as year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and engine power using Machine Learning algorithms. By leveraging Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost, the model analyzes historical data to estimate accurate car prices. The dataset undergoes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering to enhance model performance.

Developed using Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and NumPy, the project was implemented in Jupyter Notebook and VSCode. The trained models were evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² Score to ensure accuracy. This project provides insights into the key factors influencing car pricing and demonstrates the potential of ML in predictive analytics.
